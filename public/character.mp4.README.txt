PLACEHOLDER FOR DEMO VIDEO

To test the full demo mode with video download:

1. Add a video file named "character.mp4" to this /public folder
2. This can be any MP4 video file for demonstration purposes
3. When you upload an image in DEMO MODE, the app will show a "Download Video" button
4. Clicking it will download the character.mp4 file

If you don't have a video file, you can:
- Use any sample MP4 video and rename it to "character.mp4"
- Or leave it as-is and the app will still show the processing UI

The download button will only appear if character.mp4 exists in the /public folder.
